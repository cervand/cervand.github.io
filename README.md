# Hi there! 👋
Welcome to the dev environment of my personal website! 

## My Website (Under Construction) 🚧
I'm currently working on setting up my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages with my own domain (www.andrescervantes.com). As of now, the website is still under construction, and there's no content available. But don't worry, it's coming soon! 🛠️

I'm using this opportunity to build an awesome website to showcase my projects and achievements, and my favorite tech-related articles. I can't wait to share it once it's ready. If you are curious about how it is going to look, I made a mockup on Figma:

In the meantime, if you're interested in connecting, discussing tech projects, or reviewing my GitHub repositories, please feel free to take a look at them or contact me! 

## Ok, but why? 🤔
I built another website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I want to learn more so my personal website will be built using bootstrap and react.js.
